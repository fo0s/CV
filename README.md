> Level: Programmer in training

I am a `solution-oriented` and `proactive` person who is looking to harness my passion for `programming` in a change of career.

I believe development is fundamentally a technical manifestation of very specific skill sets that requires you to constantly question the world around you. I have a `natural curiosity` for how things work; from taking apart mobile handsets to `penetration testing` and `bug bounties` which I hope will serve me well in an industry where, to succeed, it is necessary to have an urge to understand things completely.

I frequently attend lectures and conferences to keep up to date with the fast paced changes in technology.

## When I'm not programming

I have a fascination with all things fermentation. A plethora of bubbling jars
in my kitchen eventually turn into breads, pickles or wines. When I’m not
playing food scientist or in front on the computer, I’m out running,
skateboarding, climbing or taking something apart to see how it works.
