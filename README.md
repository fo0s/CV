## Bart Biernat
> Programmer in training

I am a `solution-oriented` and `proactive` person who is looking to harness my passion for `programming` in a change of career.

Development is fundamentally a technical manifestation of a business problem and requires you to constantly question the world around you. I have a `natural curiosity` for how things work; from taking apart a mobile handset to writing automated scripts which I hope will serve me well in an industry where, to succeed, it is necessary to have an urge to understand things completely.

I frequently attend lectures and conferences to keep up to date with the fast paced changes in the technology.
